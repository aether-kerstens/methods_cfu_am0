# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
Very confident as I can use the current basic ones but there are more complicated ones I am unsure of how to utilize, but I do find the function of ? and ! fascinating in how it impacts the methods and variables.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Not at all. I seem to often mis-order them, or miss a key ingredient in making it tick, overall I seem to struggle in making methods more complicated then just simple inputted additions.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
What are the limits of methods and is there a right way to doing them? Do methods that you create get saved permanently or is there a specific method involved to create methods similar to the official ruby ones?
